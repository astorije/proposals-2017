Curalate

## Abstract

At Curalate, we love scala because it's elegant, concise, and, perhaps most importantly to a startup, allows us to program things quickly. The interesting technical challenge: how can we build state of the art computer vision web services that are both computationally fast and quick to build? 

## Description

At Curalate, we love scala because it's elegant, concise, and, perhaps most importantly to a startup, allows us to program things quickly. Many of our core services, however, use advanced computer vision techniques coded for speed in C or C++. This presents an interesting technical challenge: how can we build state of the art computer vision web services that are both computationally fast and quick to build? In this talk, I'll preset three stories of Curalate building computer vision web services using scala, and discuss how we balance the trade offs between computation speed and programers time.

## Bio
  
Lou Kratz is a father, tinkerer, and software engineer at Curalate.  He received his PhD in computer vision from Drexel University in 2012, and then got hit by the start-up bug in the best way. He enjoys making cool stuff using computer vision and machine learning when he's not cooking, playing bocce, or taking pictures of his daughter.
