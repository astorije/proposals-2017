## Abstract

APIs are great! But what if your APIs were coming with a type system? What if your APIs were so predictable that versioning them was history? What if consumers of your APIs could get exactly what they want at every request? Let's discover GraphQL and its implementation in Scala: Sangria.

## Description

[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) is a query language and a type system for APIs open sourced by Facebook. That's right, a type system for servers and clients to base their communication upon! It is meant to address issues commonly faced when implementing or consuming REST APIs, and brings concepts to API queries that have been at the core of software development for years: functions, interfaces, reusable components, etc.

In this talk, we will first explore what GraphQL is and what we can do with it, what are its strengths and how it compares to REST. Then we will use [Sangria](http://sangria-graphql.org/) (the Scala implementation of GraphQL) and [Akka HTTP](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.7/scala/http/) to build a GraphQL-aware API in no time. We will finally play with our API using [GraphiQL](https://medium.com/the-graphqlhub/graphiql-graphql-s-killer-app-9896242b2125) (that you should pronounce "graphical"), and we'll do it live!

## Notes

I am new to the Scala scene but a passionate developer and tech enthusiast. After meeting the great minds behind GraphQL several times, and attending NEScala in awe in the past, I have decided to try my chances this year!

Note that I am planning this talk to last 30 minutes, but I could bring it down to 15 minutes depending on offer and demand. This would be my first real conference talk and I will give everything I got to make it worth your while!

## Bio
  
I am a software developer coming from the country that brought you fries and the Statue of Liberty. I live in Boston where I currently work for CloudHealth Technologies and previously at W3C (MIT).

I used to run bi-weekly coding nights at the [Boston Area Scala Enthusiasts meetup](https://www.meetup.com/boston-scala/) which were a lot of fun, according to myself! I also like to contribute to open source projects, including some that I maintain. You can find out about them on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/astorije).
