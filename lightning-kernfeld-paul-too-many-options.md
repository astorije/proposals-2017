## Abstract

This talk shows many many ways to get the value out of an Option, from simple to fun to deranged. Of course, this isn't really about Options: it's about options! I'll share how Scala's many options intimidate me as a Scala beginner and what I'm doing to help others.

## Description

I don't have anything to add beyond 300 characters.

## Notes

At a conference with many advanced language users, it can be easy to forget about aspects of Scala that are tough for beginners to get a hold of. This is a crucial issue as Scala strives to become more popular, and I think it deserves more attention than it gets.

There are a lot of aspects of a language that can seem obvious in retrospect despite being difficult to learn, and I plan to highlight some of these that I've run into while learning Scala. I would like to use this talk as a way to start a respectful and good-natured discussion about what parts of Scala can be difficult to learn and how this can be dealt with by Scala, library writers, and application programmers.
