## Abstract

Scala is an elegant and expressive language--so why are its compilation errors so imperious and opaque? I'll talk about my experience transitioning to Scala development from PHP and make a case for a compiler that helps programmers discover the language (with the help of lots of Lucille Bluth gifs).

## Description

+ "Scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type"
+ "A pure expression does nothing in statement position"
+ "The static coercion from type a to b involves an indeterminate type"

Scala is an elegant and expressive language--so why are its compilation errors so imperious and opaque? I discovered Scala in the perfect storm of bad learning conditions: in a rush, in parallel with a map-reduce API, and as a blocker on the critical path to launching my other work after years of mostly PHP development. In that context, the Scala compiler seemed so unforgiving and inscrutable that I used to read the errors in the voice of Lucille Bluth. In this talk, I'll revisit that experience--and the process of coming to discover the beauty of the language--through *Arrested Development* gifs, and envision a world in which Scala compiler errors were written to provide entry points to Scala's core values and design, rather than a terse accusation of the programmer's wrongdoing.

## Notes

This would be a brief and mostly joke-y talk, but with some technical content around specific common errors and the higher-level concepts they correspond to!
