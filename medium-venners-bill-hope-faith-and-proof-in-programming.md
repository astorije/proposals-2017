## Abstract

This talk will show how to apply hope, faith, and proof to write the best code you can. It will compare and contrast the three, then pick a winner. Along the way, this talk will look at types and tests from a new angle and highlight a new kind of assertion that deserves a place in your toolbox.

## Description

This talk is a fresh look at how we should approach everyday coding. It will illustrate the ideas using code examples that make use of future versions of ScalaTest and Scalactic currently under development. The talk will include an introduction of what I believe is a new kind of assertion that has emerged from our work, an idea that I think deserves to be better known.
