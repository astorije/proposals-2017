Longevity By Design

## Abstract

Come see a demo of longevity: a Persistence Framework for Scala and NoSQL. You won't believe how easy it is to get started with your database application. Longevity puts the focus on the domain model, freeing you from building and maintaining a translation layer between your domain and the database.

## Description

[Longevity](http://longevityframework.org/) - a persistence framework for Scala and NoSQL - has been built from day one to isolate persistence concerns behind a clear, consistent, and easy to use API. You build your domain model using standard Scala idioms such as case classes, companion objects, options, and immutable collections. We persist your domain objects as JSON, adding whatever database constructs necessary for performance. We currently support [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), and [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) back ends.

Longevity provides you with a wide range of persistence infrastructure that you typically have to build yourself, including optimistic locking, test data generation, pre-built integration tests that exercise your repositories against a real database, and fully featured in-memory repositories for use in other integration testing. We look forward to adding support for domain model migrations (i.e., schema migrations) soon.

In this talk, we’ll talk briefly about what longevity is, and how it works. Then we’ll switch over quickly into a live demo, demonstrating how to use the library.
