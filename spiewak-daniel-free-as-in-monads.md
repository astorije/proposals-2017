## Abstract

In this talk, we will embark on an epic journey through a live editor buffer as we derive the `Free` monad from scratch for fun and profit in just a few dozen lines of code.  And once we have it, we will see how easy to use and powerful it can be when applied to the right problems.

## Description

What is the `Free`?  Where did it come from?  Why is it here?  Why would anyone *really* care?  In this talk, we will embark on an epic journey through a live editor buffer as we derive the `Free` monad from scratch for fun and profit in just a few dozen lines of code.  And once we have it, we will see how easy to use and powerful it can be when applied to the right problems.  When I was exposed to these ideas and abstractions, it forever changed the way I write software.  If you aren't careful, it could do the same for you!

## Notes

I've done this talk a couple times in formally (such as at the infamous RoomConf at LambdaConf Winter Retreat), and people always seem to enjoy it.  There've been some very memorable "ah ha!" moments.  It works best as a highly interactive session, but I've been told repeatedly that it would be well-received even in a more conferencey style.  So let's find out!

## Bio
  
Daniel Spiewak is a software developer based out of Boulder, CO. Over the years, he has worked with Java, Scala, Ruby, C/C++, ML, Clojure and several experimental languages. He currently spends most of his free time researching parser theory and methodologies, particularly areas where the field intersects with functional language design, domain-specific languages and type theory.

Daniel has written a number of articles on his weblog, [Code Commit](http://www.codecommit.com), including his popular introductory series, Scala for Java Refugees.
