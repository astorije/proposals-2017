## Abstract

In this session, Jeff will challenge the audience to re-think the ways they have been using sbt all along. Not only will they learn how to regain productivity by learning new ways to use sbt, but will also learn how to embrace the tool, rather than feel restrained by its limitations. 

## Description

Anyone familiar with Scala knows both the benefits and annoyances of using sbt. On one hand, the tool is essential for features such as automatic dependency management, continuous compilation, testing, and deployment, etc. However, itâ€™s often that we find hours are wasted on trying to fight sbt and the way it dictates our build processes. In this session, Jeff will show fellow Scala developers how to regain their productivity by both embracing sbt instead of fighting it as well as finding new ways to use sbt beyond just a build tool. Past users of Maven, Ant, and Gradle may not feel comfortable configuring and customizing their sbt build definition -- much to their own detriment -- but the potential to do so is definitely there. Accompanied by specific and compelling case studies, Jeff will challenge the audience to re-think the ways they have been using sbt all along and walk away with specific best practices to improve their overall productivity with the tool.
