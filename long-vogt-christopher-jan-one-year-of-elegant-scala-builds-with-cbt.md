## Abstract

One year of CBT, the new build tool presented last year. All major open technical questions have since been answered. We'll live demo elegant, easy-to-understand solutions for all of them, show how the dotty team uses CBT to bootstrap dotty and look the roadmap to mainstream adoption.

## Description

In particular we'll demo CBT's elegant and easy-to-use solutions for reproducible builds, task caching, dynamic configuration, multi project builds, task scoping and git dependencies. We'll write a meaningful plugin from scratch to show how easy it is. We'll show how you can use CBT to start experimenting with dotty yourself.
